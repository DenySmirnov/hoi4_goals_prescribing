# hoi4_goals_prescribing
A small Python program that will help you save time on prescribing images and effects of national focuses for the game Hearts of Iron 4.

To do this, you need to put the main .py file in the /interface folder of your mod and write the name of the required icons in the program console, and the program herself will add all the necessary parameters in the goals and goals_shine files.
